# intro-datascience-workshop
This is the repository that holds all curricular materials for the Introduction to Data Science Workshop.

##In order for this repository to work on your computer you will need the following:

1. [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-279/) - You should be ok with the version of python (usually either **2.6 or 2.7**) installed on your computer by default, but check and make sure!
2. [ipython with the notebook extension](http://ipython.org/install.html) - This will give you the environment in which we will be writing all of our code. The notebook extension is [incredibly useful](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)!
3. [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/getpandas.html) - This is the data analysis framework, built in python, that we will be using during the course. You need the latest stable version (0.16).
4. [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/install.html) - This is the machine learning framework, built in python, that we will very briefly use at the end of the course. Again, you need the latest stable version (0.16).

## The Data Sets

  * [NYC Taxi Data](http://flatiron-data-science.s3.amazonaws.com/nycTaxiData.zip)
  * [Movie Data](http://flatiron-data-science.s3.amazonaws.com/movieData.zip)
  * [Crowd Sourced Price Collection](http://flatiron-data-science.s3.amazonaws.com/Crowd-Sourced_Price_Collection_CSV.zip)

## The lessons in this repository are all stored in the folders `weekend1` and `weekend2`:

### The `weekend1` folder contains the following:
1. **Preliminaries:** Getting started with the **IPython notebook** - A brief demonstration of the **IPython notebook** and how to make the most use out of a few of its (most useful) features.
2. **Lesson 1:** We learn about the two basic datatypes in pandas and perform some really simple queries. We also learn a bit about how indexing on a dataset works.
3. **Lesson 2:** We learn the basics of **pandas** functionality by going through a publicly available dataset of movie ratings. We learn the basics of DataFrame and Series objects and some of the kinds of things we can do with them.
4. **Lab 1:** The first lab involves answering a whole suite of questions about a large dataset of actual taxi ride data from 2013 provided by the NYC T&L Commission. You should be able to do all of these questions just based on what you learned in the first lesson.
5. **Lesson 3:** We clean and add some more data to the Movielens 1M dataset while exploring more **pandas** functionality in the process.
6. **Lab 2:** The second lab involves adding additional data to the NYC Taxi dataset and answering more detailed questions about its composition, using a combination of taxi fare and trip data.

### The `weekend2` folder contains the following:
2. **Lesson 4:** We explore how to work with incomplete timeseries and learn how to plot a variety of kinds of graphs along the way. We also explore Here we will use some crowd-sourced commodity price data that's been aggregated for us by the [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/crowd-sourced-price-collection).
3. **Lab 3:** This lab takes the **World Bank Price Dataset** that we used for exploring and learning and asks you to answer some questions about it by making pretty plots.
1. **Lesson 5:** We explore additional functionality found within pandas, some tricks for massaging data quickly and really begin to understand how to work with and explore datasets using more advanced pandas functionality. We learn about more data transformations for machine learning.  We bring in a bit of sklearn to try to see if we can predict the gender of a person from within the MovieLens dataset given their viewing habits.
2. **Lab 4:** We finish by implementing our own 

##Happy Hacking!
