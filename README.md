# intro-datascience-workshop
This is the repository that holds all curricular materials for the Introduction to Data Science Workshop.

##In order for this repository to work on your computer you will need the following:

1. [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-279/) - You should be ok with the version of python (usually either **2.6 or 2.7**) installed on your computer by default, but check and make sure!
2. [ipython with the notebook extension](http://ipython.org/install.html) - This will give you the environment in which we will be writing all of our code. The notebook extension is [incredibly useful](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)!
3. [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/getpandas.html) - This is the data analysis framework, built in python, that we will be using during the course.

## The Data Sets

  * [NYC Taxi Data](http://flatiron-data-science.s3.amazonaws.com/nycTaxiData.zip)
  * [Movie Data](http://flatiron-data-science.s3.amazonaws.com/movieData.zip)
  * [Crowd Sourced Price Collection](http://flatiron-data-science.s3.amazonaws.com/Crowd-Sourced_Price_Collection_CSV.zip)

## The lessons in this repository are all stored in the folders `day1` and `day2`:

### The `day1` folder contains the following:
1. **Preliminaries:** Getting started with the **IPython notebook** - A brief demonstration of the **IPython notebook** and how to make the most use out of a few of its (most useful) features.
2. **Lesson 1:** We learn the basics of **pandas** functionality by going through a publicly available dataset of movie ratings.
3. **Lab 1:** The first lab, involving answering a whole suite of questions about a large dataset of actual taxi ride data from 2013 provided by the NYC T&L Commission.
4. **Lesson 2:**We clean and add some more data to the Movielens 1M dataset while exploring more **pandas** functionality in the process.
5. **Lab 2:** The second lab involves adding additional data to the NYC Taxi dataset and answering more detailed questions about its composition, using a combination of taxi fare and trip data.

### The `day2` folder contains the following:
1. **Lesson 3:** We explore how to work with incomplete timeseries and learn how to plot a variety of kinds of graphs along the way. Here we will use some crowd-sourced commodity price data that's been aggregated for us by the [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/crowd-sourced-price-collection).
2. **Lab 3:** This lab takes the **World Bank Price Dataset** that we used for exploring and learning and asks you to answer some questions about it by making pretty plots!

##Happy Hacking!
